        <h1>Vaccination: A Shield for Community Health</h1>
        <p>by dr. Hasan Effendy</p>
        <img src="article3.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Vaccination has been one of the most powerful tools in public health, saving millions of lives by preventing the spread of deadly infectious diseases. From childhood immunizations to adult boosters, vaccines have significantly reduced the incidence of illnesses such as measles, polio, influenza, and COVID-19. By exposing the immune system to a harmless version of a pathogen, vaccines help build immunity without causing illness. This not only protects the vaccinated individual but also those around them—especially people with weakened immune systems or those who cannot receive vaccines for medical reasons. This collective protection, known as herd immunity, is essential in preventing large-scale outbreaks. However, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and access barriers still pose challenges, particularly in low-resource settings. Strengthening public trust, improving health education, and ensuring equitable access to vaccines are all key steps in fostering a healthier, more resilient population. In today’s interconnected world, vaccination remains not only a personal health choice but a vital act of social responsibility.</p>
