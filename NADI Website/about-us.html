        <h2>Welcome to NADI</h2>
        <p>
            At NADI, we believe that managing your health should be simple, personalized, and empowering. 
            Our mission is to make medical tracking accessible and intuitive for everyone—whether you’re 
            managing a chronic condition, caring for a loved one, or just staying on top of your daily wellness.

        <h2>What is NADI?</h2>
        <p>
            NADI is a smart medical tracking app designed to help users monitor their health in real time. 
            From logging symptoms and tracking medications to setting appointment reminders and receiving 
            health alerts, NADI brings all your health data into one secure, easy-to-use platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our name, NADI, comes from the Indonesian word for "pulse"—a symbol of life, rhythm, and continuity. 
            Just like a pulse, we aim to be a steady presence in your health journey, providing meaningful 
            insights and support when you need it most.

        <h2>Why We Built NADI</h2>
        <p>
            Healthcare today can be overwhelming. Many people face delayed diagnoses, missed medications, or 
            gaps in communication with caregivers. We created NADI to close those gaps by putting smart health 
            tools directly in your hands.
